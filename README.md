# Low-Power-Design-Workshop
 Low Power Design is a cluster of techniques and studies that aim at reducing the overall power in the integrated circuit. The integrated circuit designs from CMOS(complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor). Why we choose CMOS because they have low power consumption and high noise immunity. But with low power consumption that doesn't mean it doesn't require power reduction techniques. When the complexity of the circuits increases, power demand also increases. Hence we need to work toward the low power techniques development for all the embedded devices, which you see in your daily life.

## DAY_1 - Intorduction to CMOS and Low power Design
System Perofrmance correspond with processing power or circuit speed. Perofrmance of a circuit is measure in MIPS(millions of instruction per second). In old days major concern of VLSI designer was to focus on Area and Time implementation for the Integrated Circuit on Silicon wafer because with increase in complexitiy of circuit the cost of wafer increases. But area and time are not the only parameters which can measure the performance of the circuits. Power consumption also play major role in circuit designing. 

  In all the portable electronics where ever you see the battery, designer need to focus on minimizing power or energy in order to improve the battery life. Hence total power conusmption has become the major concern and surpassed speed-area constraints.
  
 We will not deepdive into Power or Energy formula but will try to understnad the economics of Power/Energy.
